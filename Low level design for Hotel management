Backend Logic:

User Authentication:

Handles user login and signup requests.
Validates user credentials and creates new accounts if necessary.
Booking Management:
Receives booking requests from the frontend.
Validates booking details such as dates and guest count.

Database Schema:

User Table:
Stores user information such as name, email, and password.
Booking Table:
Stores booking details including user ID, check-in date, check-out date, and number of guests.
User Interface Flow:

User accesses the website and clicks on the booking type component.
The booking component appears, allowing the user to select check-in and check-out dates, specify the number of guests, and book a room.
After booking, a confirmation message is displayed, thanking the user for their booking.
By following this low-level design, we can create a website that effectively handles user authentication, booking requests, and database storage in a structured and organized manner.
